# Task Manager

## Set up

Prior to running the application you will need to install MongoDB locally: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/

For mac this can be done via brew:

```
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community
```

Install all packages with `npm i`

Run server and client concurrently: `npm run dev`
